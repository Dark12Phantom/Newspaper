        <h2 class="article-title">An Unconventional Journey: My Elementary Days at Loo Elementary School</h2>
        <img src="../images/elem.jpg" alt="Elementary School Days" class="article-image">
        
        <p>My elementary education at Loo Elementary School followed an unconventional path, marked by multiple transitions and challenges that shaped my early academic journey.</p>
        
        <h3>A Pattern of Interruptions</h3>
        <p>My elementary years were characterized by a series of unusual circumstances:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Dropped out of 2nd grade but still advanced to 3rd grade</li>
            <li>Dropped out of 3rd grade but progressed to 4th grade</li>
            <li>Dropped out of 4th grade yet moved on to 5th grade</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>This pattern was made possible because my mother, a teacher at the school, arranged for me to complete assignments at home rather than attend classes regularly.</p>
        
        <h3>The Breaking Point</h3>
        <p>In 5th grade, bullying became severe enough that I completely dropped out and had to repeat the grade the following year. During this period, I transferred to Sonshine Learning Center, a private school in our area, before eventually returning to Loo Elementary School for 6th grade.</p>
        
        <p>This unconventional path through elementary school taught me resilience and adaptability, qualities that would serve me well in my later academic pursuits.</p>
