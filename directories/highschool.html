        <img src="../images/hs.jpg" alt="High School Days" class="article-image">
        <p>The hallways of learning were filled with both laughter and the determined focus of a scholar. From Junior to Senior High School, I maintained consistent academic excellence, earning "With Honors" recognition every semester except in 8th grade.</p>
        
        <h3>Junior High School (Grades 7-10)</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Rotated through Technical and Vocational Education specialties in 7th-8th grade</li>
            <li>Specialized in ICT (among Agriculture, Carpentry, Cookery, Cloth Sewing, and Welding) in 9th-10th grade</li>
            <li>"With Honors" every semester except 8th grade</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Senior High School (Grades 11-12)</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Chose STEM track</li>
            <li>Consistent "With High Honors" recognition</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>"The discipline developed during these formative years laid the foundation for future successes," recalls one teacher. "The balance between academic rigor and technical skills in ICT provided a well-rounded education."</p>
        
        <p>These six years were typical of a student's journey, marked by memorable school events that forged lifelong friendships and shaped personal growth.</p>
