        <p>As Dark Phantom, I live at the intersection of gaming and programming - a competitive gamer by passion and aspiring developer by profession.</p>
        
        <h3>Gaming Journey</h3>
        <p>My gaming focus spans competitive FPS and MOBA titles, balanced with casual RPGs like Wuthering Waves. I particularly enjoy modding games, with Need for Speed: Most Wanted (2005) being one of my most heavily modified projects.</p>
        
        <h3>Programming Path</h3>
        <p>While proficient in Java and JavaScript, I'm actively expanding my skillset to include C, C++, and C# - essential languages for my ultimate goal of becoming a game developer. My technical interests extend to 3D modeling in Blender, combining my creative and technical sides.</p>
        
        <h3>Creative Pursuits</h3>
        <p>Beyond coding and gaming, I enjoy anime, manga, and 3D modeling - hobbies that complement my technical work and provide creative outlets. This unique blend of interests defines my approach to both gaming and software development.</p>
